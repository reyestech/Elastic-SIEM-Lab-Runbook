# Elastic-SIEM-Lab-Runbook
A client requested our services to protect their networks. We faced the challenge of our teams being located throughout the US. I created an Elastic SIEM lab environment that connects our systems using Kibana, Active Directory, and Port Forwarding. As a result, we can monitor our client's network using a single dashboard for better protection.
