# Runbook: Elastic SIEM 
#### Hector M. Reyes | SOC Analyst | [Google Docs Link | Elastic SIEM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o0JI4UZWY9FN0mybGW9WmAfAkg7dS2Scoixib0YjzEM/pub)

## **Intro**
**Description**
A client sought our security services after experiencing a company-wide security breach. We faced a significant challenge because our teams are located in different parts of the US. To provide the best protection for our clients' businesses, we operate across multiple time zones and promptly monitor various systems.

To address this challenge, I created an Elastic SIEM Lab. This lab environment enables me to remotely connect, monitor, test, and analyze various operating systems across multiple network systems. By utilizing these tools, we can ensure prompt and effective protection for our clients' businesses.

# Introduction to Elastic SIEM
## Blue Team Solution: Implementation ##  
The Blue Team has implemented a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to ensure the security of their network. The system collects logs from various sources, such as servers, endpoints, and network devices, and detects any unusual or suspicious activities through correlation and alerts. In the event of an incident, SIEM automates the incident handling process. Additionally, SIEM integrates threat intelligence to provide real-time updates on known threats, facilitating early detection.

For Blue Teams, SIEM is a crucial tool as it helps detect threats early on and prevents them from escalating. SIEM provides contextual insights by correlating logs, which aids in incident response and enhances understanding of the situation. Moreover, the customizable rules of SIEM enable Blue Teams to tailor it to their specific environment, making it more efficient and effective. Lastly, SIEM operates continuously, providing 24/7 monitoring, ensuring constant vigilance and a quick response to any potential threat.

1. **Early Threat Detection:**
   A SIEM can help detect potential threats and suspicious activities early, enabling timely intervention and preventing further escalation.
3. **Insights:**
   Crucial for understanding incidents. Correlating logs provides the necessary context for this understanding.
5. **Customizable Rules:**
   Blue Teams tailor SIEM rules to their specific environment and threat landscape. It allows them to better adapt to potential threats and ensure a more effective security system.
7. **Remote Monitoring:**
   It provides 24/7 remote monitoring for the network, detecting and alerting you to potential threats. It ensures constant vigilance from anywhere on the client's network, keeping it safe and secure.

## 1. Purpose ##
SIEM systems analyze log data from various sources to quickly detect and respond to security incidents. They utilize advanced analytics to identify anomalous activities and provide a centralized platform for monitoring and managing security events, offering security teams a comprehensive view of their organization's security posture.

## 2. Installation ##
Elastic SIEM Tools Installation:  <br /> 
Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana on your Linux Machine: 
- Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
- Logstash is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to a "stash" such as Elasticsearch.
- Kibana is an open-source data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch.
