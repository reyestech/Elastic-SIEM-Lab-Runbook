 ### [Fullstack Academy - Capstone Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o0JI4UZWY9FN0mybGW9WmAfAkg7dS2Scoixib0YjzEM/edit)

<h2>Description</h2>
A client requested our security services after experiencing a company-wide security breach. However, we encountered a significant challenge since our teams were located across different locations in the US. To provide the best possible protection to our client's businesses, we operated across multiple time zones and promptly monitored the various systems. 
<br />
<br />
To address this challenge, I created an Elastic SIEM Lab. This lab environment enables me to connect, monitor, test, and analyze various operating systems remotely across multiple network systems. By utilizing these tools, we can guarantee prompt and effective protection for our client's businesses.

1. Introduction to SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

Purpose

<br />


SIEM systems aggregate and analyze log data from various sources within an organization's network to identify and respond to security incidents effectively.

<br />

<br />


2. Installation
   
<br />

Kali Linux Installation:

Ensure you have Kali Linux installed on your system. If not, download and install the latest version from the official website.

<br />

Kali Linux Downloads

SIEM Tools Installation: Install SIEM tools on Kali Linux: 

<br />

Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.

Logstash: Logstash is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to a "stash" such as Elasticsearch.

<br />

Kibana: Kibana is an open-source data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch.
